# treasuregram
<p>This fun application was designed through the help of codeschool. It allows you to keep track of all the fantastic treasures you've found. Treasures information and images are uploaded to the database and then displayed per user.</p>
<p> Although, this is a web application and smaller mammals as well as fictional beings may not grasp the relationship of a keyboard and monitor, This app WOULD be ideally suited for a leprechaun and or squirrels.</p>
